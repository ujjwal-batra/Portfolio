     <div class="me" id="Aboutme" style="line-height: 28px;">Hey! 
I am a first year Masters student studying Human-Computer Interaction at the Georgia Institute of Technology. I believe that a designer holds in herself a power to mould the world.<br>
‘Curiosity’ is what drives me. I raise questions and then strive to find their answers. “Unanswered and undiscovered questions” fuel my curiosity. While I am keen to explore all the dimensions of the multi-faceted world of design, I am passionate about Human-Computer Interaction Design and Sustainability. <br>
I wish to pursue a research based career along the intersection of Design, Technology and Society; and yearn to do my bit as a designer to make a world of difference. <br>
I am an Indian Classical Dancer and feel blissful when my heart resonates with the music. I am blessed to be a part of a musical family and greatly enjoy our Karaoke nights. I play Badminton and have played at competitive level in school and in college. I am also an avid traveler and a photography enthusiast. I love visiting new places, making new friends and capturing the world through my lens.<br>
My philosophy is to always make a choice in favor of ‘happiness’ whatever life throws at us.

                  <div class="content">The research internship took place in the context of a project at LRI in collaboration with Inria-Saclay for the Learning Center of Université Paris-Saclay. The project aims to  create a large wall-sized installation comprising the the photographic portraits of over 100 researchers of Université Paris-Saclay by Didier Goupy, a renowned photographer, along with a rich network of information about the researchers, that will eventually be a permanent exhibit at the Learning Center. The goal of my internship project was to apply the methods and tools developed in the Human-Centered Computing group, LRI to create an interactive installation using tablets/table top kiosks with touch displays for user-friendly navigation to access the installation. I was part of an international group of research interns.

<div class="miniheadcontent"><strong>Few Interesting Points</strong><br>

<br>
<strong>Concerns:</strong><br>
1. When a user points towards the screen and if simultaneously the display of the Kiosk changes, and if the Kiosk catches the attention of the user, it might affect the direction of pointing by the user. We will have to set the speed of change etc. such that the pointing of the user doesn't get affected by the change in the display of the Kiosk nearby.<br>
After many discussions, it was agreed that due to multiple constraints, it would be uncertain whether or not Kinect would work well in the public environment. Hence I designed a system that works perfectly when operated without a Kinect and is independent in its working. The use of Kinect was left as a future add-on if required.

<div class="miniheading">Wireframing Iterations</div>
<div class="miniheadcontent">Next, I moved on to what interactions shall happen on the tabletop interface. Multiple iterations were made in order to come up with the ideal interface that best fits the needs.

MY EXPERIENCE
</div>
<div class="content">
  This project offered me a good exposure to international research in the field of HCI under two amazing mentors. I could not have utilized my summer in a more productive manner. I was part of an international group of researchers from China, Indonesia, Argentina, France, America, Switzerland, London etc. and I learned a lot from this cross-cultural exposure including life lessons that shall really help in my professional and personal life. I was also lucky to get a chance to participate in the ERC Creative workshop conducted during my internship that offered exposure to various techniques used in the LRI. <br>
  I look forward to future collaborations with my two mentors and more exposure to international research. <br>

</div>
<div class="miniheadcontent">Few Interesting Points<br>
1. Since the content on researchers that are being looked up by interested audience is static on the wall display, any new person walking past will get information about which researchers are being looked up and belonging to what field of research and if that person is interested, he/she may go and start up a conversation with the user who is already looking the researcher up. This will encourage interaction amongst the audience.<br>
2. When the user points towards a portrait, it gets zoomed up along with the ones close to it , this provides the user with an opportunity to switch the selected researcher if he so desires.<br>
<br>
Concerns:<br>
1. When a user points towards the screen and if simultaneously the display of the Kiosk changes, and if the Kiosk catches the attention of the user, it might affect the direction of pointing by the user.

</div>
<div class="miniheading">THINGS KEPT IN MIND WHILE DESIGNING THE INTERACTIONS</div>
<div class="miniheadcontent">1. The photographic portraits are art pieces displayed on a wall sized display. Even though they are digital, they must be handled with subtlety and care.<br>
2. The system must work independent of the Kinect. <br>
3. The interactions shall happen in a physical space and with another physical object and hence should complement the space around a user.

My team and I designed an educational game for the mentally disabled children. The game aimed to teach the concept of counting and numbers and the correct sequencing of the numbers to the children with the help of a toy train. The train, along with a remote, serves as a tangible user interface with which the children are expected to communicate. We were mentored by Dr. Keyur Sorathia (Head, Embedded Interactions Lab). My role primarily comprised of Primary and Secondary Research, Brainstorming, Conceptualization and defining interactions and Video Making for documentation <br><br>

  Major learnings for the User Study
</div>
<div class="miniheadcontent">
  We majorly learned about the teaching methods used by the teachers to develop the necessary mental and motor skills that shall help the children in living their lives independently and fit into the outside world to the greatest possible extent.
<br><br>
While teaching numbers, the following were of utmost importance. <br>
1. Form or structure of number <br>
2. Count order <br>
3. Concept of greater and lesser <br><br>

Efforts were put in to combine real life objects to the learning process. This helped them relate better and understand the concepts to a greater extent. Another well known technique used was that of repetition. When something is repeated a lot of times in various manners, directly and indirectly, it tends to be learned better with a longer lasting understanding of the same

  Objectives

  Based on the learnings and problems observed and studied, we defined our Objectives as follows:<br><br>
  1. To teach the children the numbers in the correct order or sequence.<br>
2. To teach the concept of the quantity a number holds.<br>
3. Teach them using instances from the real world so they are directly connected to the real world and the numbers. do not remain an abstract concept for them.<br>
4. To improve their motor skills, concentration and patience.<br>
5. To keep them entertained and happy.

    Key points from the literature
  </div>
    <div class="content">
  Counting Techniques <br><br>
  1. Rote Counting: In this technique, the student is made to repeat the sequence of numbers while pointing at the same simultaneously. This helps the student to memorize the sequence and recognize the numbers visually.<br><br>

2. Point Counting: In this technique, the student is made to count a set of objects in the correct sequence without missing any number or repeating the same number more than once.<br><br>

3. Rational Counting: In this technique, the student learns about the quantity, a number carries. He realizes that the last number counted is equal to the total number of object counted till then. This forms the basis of addition for the child. This is also a pre-requisite for reading time on a traditional clock.<br><br>

4. Counting on: In this technique, the child learns to count from any number (say 3, 4, 5 and not 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) that may or may not be the beginning (the number 1) as taught to them.
    </div>
    <div class="content italy getinthemiddle">
  While teaching counting, one first needs to teach a child the concept of ‘1’. Various methods can be used for the same. Once the child is clear about what ‘1’ signifies, the concept of ‘one more’ is introduced. This helps to teach them the number to i.e. 1 and 1 more. Once the child is comfortable with the concept of 2, the following numbers are introduced as before.
  </div>
  <div class="heading" id="tuiheading">
  Brainstorming and Conceptualization
  </div>
  <div class="content">
  Games have long been a very effective method of learning. They are fun and addictive and make learning an enjoyable process for the children. We decided to work on making an interactive game, with a screen-less interface that shall also try to improve the motor skills of the children. <br>
We looked into various real life scenarios that can be implemented into a game. In this manner, we meet two goals: one, they learn the concept of counting and second, they are made familiar with a real life situation that will help them better relate to it when they experience the same in reality.
For our game, we chose the working of a train on a railway track.
  </div>
  <div class="content getinthemiddle italy">
  Seeing something work after performing an activity or a difficult task acts as a strong positive reinforcement. It encourages the child to put a little extra effort into the activity in order to receive the reward of a working product. Keeping this in mind, we conceptualized a mechanism where “running of train” is considered to be a positive reinforcement for the child.

<div class="padded">
<div class="miniheading">
  The concept
</div>
<div class="miniheadcontent">
  A number (say x) is entered on the remote by the student or teacher that turns the feedback light blue. The child is expected to place and connect the compartments in the correct order upto the entered number (i.e. x). This shall result in the running of the train on the track which shall stop after 'x' rounds where x was the entered number.
  Appropriate feedback is provided as the child interacts with the game.

    Components Used<br><br>

1. Train Set (1 engine, 4 compartments)<br>
2. Two Arduinos (Micro-controllers)<br>
3. Two Nrf modules (For data-transfer)<br>
4. Jumper Wires<br>
5. Resistors<br>
6. Motor<br>
7. Battery<br><br>

The electronic circuit of the game is as shown below:
  </div>
  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/3.4.png" alt="">
  <div class="content">
    The circuit consists of two parts, the train and the remote.
The remote consists of an Arduino connected to an Nrf module that sends signals wirelessly to the Nrf module connected to the Arduino that is further connected to the train circuit.<br>
The train consists of an Arduino that is connected to an Nrf module that receives information from the Remote. The circuit is divided into 5 parts. One is the engine and the other four represent their respective compartments. Each compartment is connected to its consecutive compartment by a main connection. This main connection is soldered with three other wires to form a single male connection. <br>
If a teacher enters a number, say 4. When the child connects the first compartment to the engine, the second compartment to the first, the third to the second and the fourth to the third, the train starts to run with a gap of 5 secs (Time required for the child to move the hands away after making the connection)

  Challenges
  </div>
  <div class="miniheadcontent">
  We prototyped the entire circuit and the working can be seen in the video above, However, due to constraints of the train set available, the circuit could not be embedded into the trains perfectly.
The connections were not firm and the connections had to be precisely made for the train to run.
Since this required great motor skills, it was not able to test the game with the children. <br><br>

In the future, we shall use 3-D printing to carefully design the train structure so as to contain the circuit comfortably and the connections can be made easily.

  DESIGN METHODOLOGIES
</div>
<div class="roundedboxindeate italy">
  In view of the central responsibility of designers for the technical and economic properties of a product, and the commercial importance of timely and efficient product development, it is important to have a defined design procedure to find good solutions. <br>
This procedure must be flexible, and at the same time be capable of being planned, optimized and verified. Design methodology, is a concrete course of action for the design of technical systems that derives its knowledge from design science and cognitive psychology, and from practical experience in different domains. It includes: plans of action to link working steps and design phases according to content and organization; strategies, rules and principles to achieve general and specific goals; and methods to solve individual design problems or partial tasks.<br>

    <div class="content">
      My contribution to the project involved searching for design methods for products from various sources for the various design stages. I read case studies on the various methods and also sorted them according the four defined activities in the template (Generate, Evaluate, Modify, Select). Further, I categorized them based on the three pillars of sustainability. <br>
    The methods were then made part of the InDeaTe database and were produced as results of proceeding with the design cycle on the tool.

    INDO US DISSEMINATION WORKSHOP

  <div class="miniheading">
    Design of sustainable systems
  </div>
  <div class="content">
    Goal of the workshop:  to disseminate to engineers of the future the key ideas of sustainability, and train them for designing sustainable systems utilizing the key findings from a two year project under the aegis of the Indo-US Joint Networked R&amp;D Center of Excellence on Design of Sustainable Products, Services and Manufacturing Systems, that has been funded by the Indo-US Science and Technology Forum - a bilateral forum funded by the Governments of India and the USA.<br><br>
    In the workshop, I helped in conducting (and also participated) 2 design sessions of which one was conducted without the use of the tool and one with the use of the tool. Later, feedback offered by the participants about the tool, ease of usage, understanding of the tool and the design process, the training modules were analyzed and studied for further development of the tool. <br>
  I also voluntarily took the responsibility of covering the entire workshop through photographs.

<div class="miniheadcontent">
  Based on the analysis conducted of the feedbacks after the design session in relation to the use to the tool 'InDeaTe', it was found that the user interface can be made more user friendly to help the people navigate easily through the design cycle.
I tried and helped on the same along with my ongoing research work. <br>

    The logo reflects an arrow(upwards) that majorly indicates two things: one that design leads to progress of the entire world as a whole (it can also be seen as a mountain rising high) and the other indicates the nature of InDeaTe i.e. a step by step process through the entire design cycle. Also, the three squares indicate the three pillars of sustainability, another very important component of InDeaTe. The squares are connected into a continuous chain, indicating the ITERATIVE nature of the design process.

The interview questions asked the parents about their schedule on a typical weekday and the problems they face while performing the various tasks in the house and outside.

We then arranged these 43 groups into 6 distinct categories- <br><br>

                    The parents we interviewed all had different stories to tell. Some were taking a break from their careers and were planning to go back to work after a few years while others were deliberate in their choice to be a long term stay-at-home parent. Despite their differences, we found that the majority of the parents faced the same challenge — time management. Finally, we settled on the following user space:
                    <b>Enable SAHPs to manage their time more effectively to have more time for themselves. </b>
                    as this seemed interesting to the team and we believed to could greatly affect the overall happiness quotient of a stay at home parent.

  User Feedback- Design Alternatives
</div>
<div class="content">We showed three stay-at-home parents the wireframes of the three concepts with a description of the features. We conducted semi-structured interviews with them that asked them their overall impressions of the system, what they liked and disliked about the concepts and how do they see themselves using these design in their lives. We also inquired about which of these designs serves their most urgent need. <br>

All three stay at home parents preferred the smart scheduler over the other two concepts. Smart Scheduler was the most holistic solution of the three and it solved the most urgent need in their life (time management) and augmented and improved on the systems they currently use to keep track of time.<br>

<div class="content">The smart scheduler is a physical screen  (17” x 22”) that is oriented horizontally so that it is easily accessible at an eye level situated on a wall in the house. <br><br>
The main features of the system are:<br>
1. Daily schedule <br>
  <img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/ss-08.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin: 15px, 15px;">
Parents can see their daily schedule on the timeline on the leftmost side of the screen. The timeline displays six hours at a time so that parents can see the details of the next few hours. Each event is represented with an icon, a title, a time, and any notes the parent wants to add. To cancel an event, the user can swipe it away. To edit it, the user can long press it the see the options pop-up. <br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/ss-09.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin: 15px, 15px;">
2. Preview of the next week’s events<br>
Parents can see a preview of their weekly schedules on the right side of the screen. We made the choice to show only icons to reduce the parents’ cognitive load and avoid overwhelming them. To view the timeline for a specific day in the week, users can tap on it in the weekly preview and it will expand to show the details for that day.<br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/ss-10.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin: 15px, 15px;">
3. Scheduling events: <br>
Users can use the digital sticky notes on the right side of the screen to add events to their schedule. To create an event, users can enter the event details on a sticky note with a corresponding category using the stylus, keyboard, or voice input. The user then drags the sticky note onto the timeline and the Smart Scheduler will automatically detect the event title, type, time, and notes and place it in the appropriate spot with a descriptive icon. There are 6 categories of sticky notes: chores, self-care, errands, appointments, custom, and to-do. <br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/ss-11.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin: 15px, 15px;">
4. Expandable footer<br>
The expandable footer contains the monthly calendar, analytics dashboard, suggestions, and motto of the month. The unexpanded footer shows a preview of the analytics dashboard and suggestion and also contains clickable icons for keyboard input, voice input, volume, wifi, and settings.<br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/ss-12.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; float: right; margin-top: 0px; margin: 15px, 15px;">
5. Mobile app<br>

The Smart Scheduler mobile app contains the basic functionality of the wall calendar and is designed to be complimentary in its functionality. SAHPs are able to view their daily schedule, weekly schedule, and a preview of the month. They can also enter events on the mobile app by entering the title, time, date, and/or notes about the event.<br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/ss-13.jpg" alt="" style="width: 50%; float: left; margin-top: 0px; margin: 15px, 15px;">
6. Settings<br>

We grouped the Settings as per the following.<br>

a. My Account- User’s name, Email, Change password, Hobbies, Wi-Fi <br>
b. Display- Sleep after, Night Mode, Adaptive Brightness<br>
c. Sounds- Volume, Touch Sounds, Touch Vibration, Alert Sounds, Customize Sounds<br>
d. Accessibility- Screen Reader, Magnification, Color Filters, High Contrast, Toggle Button<br>
e. Languages and Input- Languages, Virtual Keyboard, Smart Pen, Spell Checker, Autofill <br>
f. Date and Time- Time zone, 24-hour time<br>
g. Security and Privacy- Screen Lock, Lock Screen Notifications, Location<br>
h. Calendars- Imported Calendars, Link Devices<br>
i. System- Backup- Updates, Request Maintenance, Feedback, Help, Reset, Shut Down.

  Challenges
</div>
<div class="content">
1. The Smart Scheduler relies heavily on user buy-in. If a user does not consistently schedule events, the system will not be able to analyze the breakdown of activities accurately and suggest appropriate events for the user’s free time. <br>

2. Due to its large touch screen interface, Smart Pencil, OCR, and the advanced features, the Smart Scheduler might not be affordable for a number of families, especially some families with stay at home parents (and therefore one income source for the family).<br>

3.The Smart Scheduler needs to be continuously plugged in to a power source because having a battery would not only add a task of charging it from time to time, but also add to its cost. However, the Smart Scheduler would then need to be hung near a socket all the time. It would need a long wire if the socket is far away. <br>

4. Owing to the Smart Scheduler’s large dimensions (17” x 22”), it needs an empty wall in the house so that it’s easy for the parent to use it on the go. This adds constraints and introduces dependency on an external factor - availability of a wide enough empty wall.<br>

5. About half of the SAHPs that we interviewed are uncomfortable with technology. Because of this issue, we’re uncertain about the Smart Scheduler being able to accommodate all SAHPs since it relies heavily on basic tech knowledge.<br>

6. The system needs to wifi access to function at its best because of weather prediction, ability to sync with phones or a spouse’s calendar, etc. This creates external dependencies, especially for families who can’t afford or need wifi at home.<br>

7. The Smart Scheduler only encourages SAHPs to spend time for themselves - it does not make them do it. These suggestions might be ignored and be given lesser priority by SAHPs

  EVALUATION
</div>

<div class="content">
All participants were recruited via convenience sampling. We conducted a total of six interviews with four stay-at-home parents and two non-stay-at-home participants; we recruited a combination of stay at home parents and non-stay at home parents due to time constraints. Ideally we wanted to conduct in-field interviews with a paper prototype but due to constraints on time and resources, we performed a few remote evaluation sessions using an online prototype. <br>
We gave them two tasks to conduct and asked about their experience while doing them- <br>

<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/ss-14.jpg" alt="">


There were three main parts of the evaluation <br>
1. Think aloud followed by questions, <br>
2. Online SUS survey, <br>
3. Desirability analysis.<br>

The user found this system to be better than existing processes they use to schedule things. They indicated that this is more intuitive and easier to use than existing mobile applications and physical calendars. They features of the system make scheduling more efficient. They found the interactions with the system to be intuitive. <br>

Some concerns of the users were- <br>

                    Many online social platforms have become hugely popular in recent years for sharing information with one another. Unfortunately, an increasing tendency regarding misuse and manipulation of these communication platforms by vested interests has also come into notice. <br>

A very good example is the spread of fake news, rumors and sinister messages around India using WhatsApp. In the month of April 2018, following the false rumors about child kidnappers, over 22 people were assaulted and killed in India. Messages are being shared on WhatsApp to develop tension between religious communities. Fake pre-election poll purportedly sponsored by the BBC, are being extensively circulated to influence voters in India. <br>

Although, these popular online communication platforms are fulfilling an important social need, their unintended and malicious use cannot sustain the positive social impact of these technologies.

                    I carried out an in-depth qualitative user study over a period of around 3 months. The objective was to learn about the WhatsApp usage of individuals and identify factors that influence its usage positively or negatively. A total of 18 regular users of WhatsApp from India (9 male and 9 female) were interviewed.

                  <div class="content">
                    An approach of purposeful sampling with maximum variation was used to select the participants. The participants were aged between 7 and 69 yrs (median age 38 yrs). All interviews were audio recorded to complement and support the notes taken during the interview sessions during the user study with prior permission of the participants. <br></br>

                    For each participant, a semi-structured interview was conducted which comprised both open-ended and closed-ended questions. 

The questionnaire for the study was designed to explore the following variables: <br>
1. Demographics- Gender, age, native place, and profession. <br>

2. Appropriation- Usage of WhatsApp. <br>

3. Incorporation- Time spent on WhatsApp. General intent of usage. Type and person with whom communicated. Kind of information shared and received. Etc. <br>

4. Objectification- What is WhatsApp for them? Recent satisfying or unsatisfying experience through WhatsApp. Etc. <br>

5. Conversion- Problems faced. Preference and usage of other platforms. <br>

                  <div class="content">
                  In vivo and descriptive coding was performed on the transcribed data. On identifying a fragment of text, where any reason for a variation in WhatsApp usage could be observed, it was highlighted and was allocated a code that described the chosen fragment. In another iteration of coding of the fragments of identified text, the codes whose meaning was redundant were assigned a single uniform code. These codes were then grouped together to form ‘factors’. These factors were defined as aspects that affected the ‘capacity’ of usage of WhatsApp. Capacity was defined ability to engage with the platform in a way that is meaningful and positive.

 <div class="content">A framework was designed using the communication model of Gulf of Evaluation and Execution as proposed by Don Norman. Norman suggests that any action has two parts to it- executing the action and evaluating the results. Both execution and evaluation affect the mental state of a user and thus the “capacity” of the user. He has divided the cycle of an action from execution to evaluation in 7 stages namely plan, specify, perform, perceive, interpret, compare and goal. The effect of each factor was analyzed with respect to the stages of this framework and the factors were assigned to the stage in the model that they affected. Then the results were organized in a spreadsheet clearly marking the stage of the framework, the factors, the codes from where the factors originated and the frequency of each of these factors.</div>

                <div class="content">
                  Thus, a group of factors was derived that affected the ‘capacity’ of usage by a user and their degree of effect, based on the frequency. Each factor was clearly defined and named. <br>

The factors were then grouped based on the what aspect of the system do they affect or are affected by. The aspects being- Design, Technology, Emotions, Miscellaneous. <br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-14.png" alt="">
The grouping helped me identify what factors can be affected by altering the design of the system.

2. The system should ensure the availability, awareness and context of use of its features. <br>
 <br>


<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-25.png" alt="">

3. The system should help the users form easy and relevant connections by working within the constraints of available information and technology. <br>

<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-26.png" alt="">
4. The system must ensure timely, reliable and transparent feedback and feed-forward mechanisms in chosen exchanges of information and conversations. <br>
 <br>

<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-27.png" alt="">
5. The system should offer control to the user to determine what information or data to receive or deliver. <br>
 <br><br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-29.png" alt="">

6. System should allow the user to reliably connect and share information across other applications <br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-30.png" alt="">
 <br>
7. The system should ensure security of shared data for all its users and users must be aware of the security measures in place and its limitations. <br>
<br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-31.png" alt="">

8. The system should promote trust and encourage users to provide accurate information through the system. (Maturity) <br>
Example: Report Feature (Positive), Lack of measures to prevent fake profiles (Negative)<br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-32.png" alt="">
9. System should be updated regularly to accommodate new technological, social and cultural requirements of the user. <br>
Example: Negative: Applications such as Orkut failed because they didn’t adapt themselves with the upcoming needs of the society. Positive: Messenger and WhatsApp identified the growing popularity of ‘stories’ feature on Instagram and made changes to their systems accordingly. <br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-33.png" alt="">

10. The system should be able to adapt to the need of the user based on different contexts of conversation(formal/informal etc.). (Quality of Life) <br>
Example: Negative: A good deal of plans are made on WhatsApp. Groups of all sorts are made but WhatsApp doesn’t provide any special features to plan the events smoothly. Positive: Messenger however, lets us set reminders and conduct polls while planning a meeting or event. <br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-35.png" alt="">
11. The system should ensure the disposal of irrelevant data and keep records of relevant data based on the users choice. (Quality of Life) <br>
Example: Negative: WhatsApp does nothing to encourage the deletion of unnecessary and irrelevant data (Inactive groups etc. ) from the platform. Positive: Google Photos encourages the user to empty space on phone when the data is uploaded online. <br>
<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-34.png" alt="">
12. The system should offer help and answer any question that a user has regarding the system at all times. <br>
Example: Negative: Most applications, including WhatsApp ask the user to write to them in case they need help with anything on the system. The conversion rate of people who need help with the platform and those who write is very less. Positive: Uber has a wonderful help tab with answers to all probable problems a user may face. It makes it very user to report a problem he has been facing with the system.

  PRESENTATION

  I presented the guidelines in the form of commandments of design via posters. I distributed the same in the presentation of my project.

  EVALUATION
</div>
<div class="content">
  To test the application of every guideline on the platform, I proposed of set questions to perform a user survey. The user shall use a Likert Scale to answer the questions. The opinion expressed in each point will also be reverted to negate any bias from the survey. The statements shall then be randomized while testing.

<img class="img-fluid d-block mx-auto picture" src="img/portfolio/wa-38.png" alt=""><br><br>

<div class="content">
  I tested the guidelines using these questions with a pre-final year design undergraduate student. I performed two sessions with the student. In the first session, I asked him to redesign WhatsApp to make it more socially sustainable (I explained to him what social sustainability means and the various aspects of it). Later, I gave him the set of guidelines and asked him to to apply these guidelines to evaluate WhatsApp and come up with possible design ideas to attend to the design gaps that he discovers as he applies the guidelines. The guidelines provided a clear direction to the design undergrad and helped trigger design ideas. The quantity of ideas during the brainstorming session where the guidelines were provided were much higher than without the guidelines. He could relate to the guidelines and acknowledge their contribution towards a socially sustainable internet community. <br><br><br><br>

                      As part of my course on Graphic Design, I conceptualized and prototyped a calendar taking inspiration from a Film Roll. It works such that every frame of the roll is a date on the calendar. The roll can be rotated as the days pass to change the dates. I was mentored by Dr. Nanki Nath (Indian Institute of technology, Guwahati). I was responsible for the entire process of conceptualizing and making the calendar into a tangible product. The product was made in the mechanical workshop at my department.

  The calendar takes the shape of a film roll that rests on a wooden block. Every block of the film roll were replaced by a day of a month and 12 rolls for the 12 months were made for prototyping purposes due to to thicker material available in the department workshop In the final product, I thinner material can be used to make one whole roll.<br>
  The date in the middle reflects the date of today, graphics of which are inspired by any special event that might occur on the date. On the rolling the film roll, we can switch the dates.

  The cylindrical rolls in the prototype are made up of paper. Strips of paper are
  rolled to form two cylinders. The ends of the frame strip are joined to the cylinders and then the strip is rolled along the cylinder. The cylinders should be rotated to change the date.

                      Techniche is the annual Techno-Management festival of the Indian Institute of Technology Guwahati, India. It witnesses a new zenith of techno-management events ranging from raging robotics to corporate module to inspiring lecture series to awe striking workshops to jubilant nights and serves as a distinguished platform for entrepreneurs, innovators and technocrats to showcase their abilities as every edition sought to take a leap forward in redefining and revolutionizing the technology.<br><br>I worked in a team of 10 designers and led the team along with 3 other leads. I was responsible for conceptualizing and creating various graphic works to promote the festival and its events globally.
